## Pairing your charge point

There are a few ways you can perform the initial pairing of your charge point.

!!! note "Note"

    Note you only need to pair your device once.  After that you can just use the RSP app to simply start/stop or schedule your charging session as per the instructions below.

### Initial pairing of your charge point
The easiest way is to scan the QR code on the front of the charge point, but if you don't have access to a phone with QR scanning capability, we provide an alternate method using the charge point ID code, printed under the QR code on the charge point.

=== "Scan QR Code"

    1. Point your phone camera the QR code on the front of the charge point
    2. You will be taken to the RSP sign up screen where you can create a new account using your email address or an existing Google account if you prefer.
    3. Once you have finished signing up, the system will remember the charge point ID you just scanned and assign it to your account.
    4. If you have multiple charge points and want to add another, just scan the QR code or use the "Manage Charge Points" menu item (refer image below).

=== "Use charge point ID code"

    1. Visit [https://prod.readysteadyplug.com](https://prod.readysteadyplug.com)
    2. You will be taken to the RSP sign up screen where you can create a new account using your email address or an existing Google account if you prefer.
    3. Once you have finished signing up, tap the "Manage Charge Points" menu item and enter the charge point ID (refer image below). In the example above, the charge point ID is **(1234ABCD5-1)**.

### Adding an additional charge point

### Removing a charge point
If you want to remove the charge point from your account for any reason, Tap the "<span style="color: red;">x</span>" under **Action** to remove a charge point. Note you will no longer be able to start a charging session until you re-pair.
If you want to re-add it into your account, just follow the pairing process again, as described above.


## Setting up billing details

At theÂ end of the process your credit card is charged $20, which will be your initial balance. This is also the amount that the system automatically charges your credit card once the balance goes below $5 (similar to how E-Toll or Opal cards work.)

## Starting and stopping a charge session
### Manual start/stop
Now that you have credit in your account, you can start a charging session.
Simply tap on **Control Charging** and tap the "On-Off" toggle.
